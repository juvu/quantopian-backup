# Quantopian Backup

Since Quantopian decided to shut down, I am migrating the code I wrote here. It is a collection of strategies that I wrote in my free time, over 2 summers and 1 winter break. I wrote them because I wanted to do something new that would be both fun and something to put on my resume.

All of these are unoptimized and rudimentary. I did some minor optimizations for some but I'm sticking to the original code for most.

I heavily relied on the Pipeline API provided by Quantopian, thus they will not run outside of that environment. I may work on them in future should I decide to expand and optimize any of these and make them live.
